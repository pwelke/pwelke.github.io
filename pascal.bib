  abstract={Nonwoven materials, characterized by a random fiber structure, are essential for various applications including insulation and filtering. An industrial long-term goal is to establish a framework for the simulation-based design of nonwovens. Due to the random structures, simulations of material properties on fiber network level are computational expensive. We propose a predictive model hierarchy for inferring an important material property---the nonwoven tensile strength behavior. The model hierarchy is built using regression-based approaches, including linear and polynomial models, which provide interpretable results. This allows for significant speedup (six orders of magnitude) over the conventional simulations, while achieving good prediction results (R2=0.95{\$}{\$}R^2=0.95{\$}{\$}). The proposed models open the application to nonwoven material design, as they provide accurate and cost-effective surrogates for predicting material properties. In this way, our work serves as a proof of concept.},

  abstract={The application of complex machine learning models has elicited research to make them more explainable. However, most explainability methods cannot provide insight beyond the given data, requiring additional information about the context. We argue that harnessing prior knowledge improves the accessibility of explanations. We hereby present an overview of integrating prior knowledge into machine learning systems in order to improve explainability. We introduce a categorization of current research into three main categories which integrate knowledge either into the machine learning pipeline, into the explainability method or derive knowledge from explanations. To classify the papers, we build upon the existing taxonomy of informed machine learning and extend it from the perspective of explainability. We conclude with open challenges and research directions.},
